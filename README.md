# Trisha Sanghal Secureframe Coding Challenge
**To run this application:**

1) Download and save this project. 
2) In a terminal window, navigate to this project's folder. 
3) Use the following commands to install the necessary libraries if they are not already installed:
```
$ pip install flask
$ pip install clubhouse
$ pip install pandas
```
4) Use the following command to start the application:
```
$ python -m flask run
```
3) Note the localhost port, and enter the following into a browser tab:
```
localhost:$PORT/dashboard
```
For example:
```
localhost:5000/dashboard
```
4) This should display a dashboard with two tables, as specified [here](https://www.notion.so/Secureframe-Coding-Challenge-3e8fb4a815374e48a9cebceb831796ff). 

**Quick note:** The hover functionality requires one to hover over the follower counts (the numbers specifically, not the entire table cell), and it might initially be slightly delayed in displaying the followers list.
